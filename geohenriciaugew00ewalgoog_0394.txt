Ρ. 6. §. 10 et 11. De linguae, quae nunc in Ambiae
penetralibus inter Beduinos viget, ratione meliora· et certiora
tandem nos edocuit J. L. Burckhardt, notes on the Be-
douins and Wahabys (London 1830) p. 211. Locum memo·
rabilem integrum describere placet· “The Bedouin dialect ns
every where different from the Arabic spoken ιιι towns and
villages, even among these tribes whose territories adjoin
the inhabited places, and who mix in frequent intercourse
with town’-s people. 'Phe Bedoulns use a dialect much more
correct and grammatica! than the low language of the sy

⁹ rian and Egyptian mob, who is wholly excluded from the

encampments of the Desert. There ιε, however, among the
Bedouins themselves, a great variety of dialects; — but they
all agree in pronouneing each letter with much predsion,
expressing its exact force or power, which , with respect to

the letters ὦ ὃ ub Β, is never the case among the inhabi-
tants of towns. The Bedouins agree also universally in
using, as common, many select· words, which ιιι the towns
· would be called ‘literal terms’ (5⁵³- V3¹6) and ιιι speaking

always with grammatical aecuracy. - Ι shall here venture
to affirm, that by far the best Arabic ιιι spoken ιιι the De-
sent, and that Bedouins are as much distinguished fron
others Arabs, 'by the purity of their language, as they arc
by that of their manners. That they have preserved, during
so ¹many centuries, the purity of theirjanguage, without
books or writings , may with probability to be ascribed te
the frequent practise of learning by heart and reciting poe-
try. Young persons are thus accustomed to the use of select
and elegant expressions; and there are always in the campe
some old men who take deligbt ιιι explaining the recondite
m'eanings and other difficulties that may occur in the poetas?
